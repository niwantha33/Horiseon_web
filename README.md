What motivated me to do this project was it's current status of limited accessibility.I wanted to improve the accessibility so that it will increase the and search engine optimization.Since the existing code was developed using non-semantic elements and without accessibility feature, the site's SEO was limited.By building this project, the site will standout amongst its competitors and will be easy access to anyone including people with special needs.

While working in this project, I learnt HTML semantic elements, accessibility features and SEO.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
